# Automated Customer Support Ticket Classification for Financial Company

In this project, I'm tackling the challenge of automating customer support ticket classification for a financial company. Customer complaints are vital for identifying service shortcomings and improving overall satisfaction, but manually processing them becomes cumbersome as the customer base grows. My goal is to build a model that can classify these complaints into relevant categories based on the products or services involved.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Automate customer support ticket classification for a financial company.
- **Challenge**: Manual processing of customer complaints becomes cumbersome as the customer base grows.
- **Goal**: Build a model to classify complaints into relevant categories based on products or services involved.

## Methodology
- **Topic Modeling**: Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to detect patterns and recurring words in complaints.
- **Categories**: Classifying complaints into clusters such as credit card/prepaid card, bank account services, theft/dispute reporting, mortgages/loans, and others.

## Benefits
- **Streamlined Process**: Automated classification streamlines the customer support process.

## Conclusion
Automating customer support ticket classification for a financial company using NMF for topic modeling will improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. The model's ability to categorize complaints into relevant clusters will streamline the support process, leading to better service and increased customer loyalty.
