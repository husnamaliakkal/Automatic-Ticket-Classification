In this project, I'm tackling the challenge of automating customer support ticket classification for a financial company. Customer complaints are vital for identifying service shortcomings and improving overall satisfaction, but manually processing them becomes cumbersome as the customer base grows. My goal is to build a model that can classify these complaints into relevant categories based on the products or services involved.

By leveraging non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for topic modeling, I aim to detect patterns and recurring words in the complaints, allowing me to categorize them into clusters such as credit card/prepaid card, bank account services, theft/dispute reporting, mortgages/loans, and others. This automated classification will streamline the customer support process, enabling the company to resolve issues more efficiently and enhance customer loyalty.
